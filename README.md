#Sheet Music Sight Reading Flash Cards

![Note Icon](favicon.ico)

##Overview 
This is a simple musical notation flash card application. 

I wrote this out of a desire to improve my reflexive sight-reading speed behind the piano. 

The application displays one random card before pausing and continuing to the next random card. The number of cards-per-deck is dependent on the input of the user. The user also controls the speed at which the cards are dealt. 

Here are the user-generated options:

* **Total** - This is the number of cards per session. 

* **Clef** - Boolean operator.

* **Speed** - Based on milliseconds. 

* **Show Names** - Boolean operator

### Future 
Eventually I'll give the user an option to change the card size. Sheet music is printed in different fonts, shapes and sizes... so I've found it best for the brain if you train with variable sizes.
