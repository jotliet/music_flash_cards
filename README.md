#Sheet Music Sight Reading Flash Cards

![Note Icon](favicon.ico)

##Overview 
This is a simple musical notation flash card application. The logic is written in Javascript, but it can be transponsed into any language because the concepts are rudimentary.  

I wrote this out of a desire to improve my reflexive sight-reading speed behind the piano. 

The application displays a random card. 

The goal was for the user to have their hands on the piano while the application runs, therefor the process is automated. 

There are a few user-generated options:

* **Total** - This is the number of cards per session. 

* **Clef** - Boolean operator.

* **Speed** - Based on milliseconds. 

* **Show Names** - Boolean operator

### Future 
Eventually I'll give the user an option to change the card size. Sheet music is printed in different fonts, shapes and sizes... so I've found it best for the brain if you train with variable sizes.

Also, I'd like to eliminate the .PNG images and use vector images, but that would require more than the 3 hours of life I've allotted to this application.
